[Plant Health Disease Detection](https://github.com/SonaliShakhawar/Plant-Health-detection)

##  Overview
This project leverages **deep learning** and **computer vision** techniques to detect and classify potato plant diseases using leaf images. The application is designed to help farmers and agricultural professionals by providing an **accurate and real-time disease detection system**.

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Mobile Application Development**

##  Key Features
- **Accurate Disease Detection**: Utilizes a **CNN-based deep learning model** with a **30% higher accuracy** compared to traditional methods.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Processes **leaf images instantly** and classifies them as **Healthy, Early Blight, or Late Blight**.
- **Optimized Performance**: Achieves **20% faster processing speed**, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **User-Friendly Mobile Application**: Allows **farmers to upload images** and receive **instant disease classification**.
- **Empowering Agriculture**: Helps in **early disease detection**, enabling timely intervention and **preventing crop loss**.

##  How It Works
1. **Upload a leaf image** via the mobile application.
2. The deep learning model processes the image and predicts one of the three categories:
   -  **Healthy Leaf**
   -  **Early Blight**
   -  **Late Blight**
3. The result is displayed instantly, providing actionable insights.

##  Model Performance
- Trained on a **diverse dataset** of potato leaf images.
- Uses **CNN architecture** for high-precision classification.
- Optimized model improves **processing speed by 20%**.

##  Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SonaliShakhawar/Plant-Health-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy opencv-python
   ```
3. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Deploy the model in a **mobile application** for real-time disease detection.

##  Future Enhancements
- Expand the dataset for improved classification accuracy.
- Implement multi-crop disease detection.
- Integrate **IoT-based sensors** for real-time field monitoring.
